Files ending with `.jzintv.txt` were generated by stepping through jzIntv's
debugger with a simple script, outputting the result to a text file, and
manually cleaning up the output.

Refer to jzIntv's included documentation (chiefly `jzintv/doc/debugger.txt`) for
a detailed reference of what the output means.

The filename format is as follows:

```
<rom-filename>.jzintv.txt
```

Where `<rom-filename>` refers to a file in `./roms` (see `roms/README.md` for
MD5s of the files you need to ensure you have the right data for testing).
