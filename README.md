# INTV-WEB

An Intellivision emulator for the web.

## Status

Nonfunctional. Just getting the basic boilerplate going.

## Why?

There might be an INTV emulator for the web out there already, but I couldn't find
one easily.

I'd also like to implement a higher performance emulator for embedded/low-power
devices, so this implementation can serve as a reference for a port to a
lower-level language some day, I hope.

Mainly I just wanted to do this as an exercise, so if you want a fast, accurate,
and user-friendly emulator, you may want to look elsewhere.

### Inspiration

Special thanks to [Dan Grise](https://www.youtube.com/@dangrise6182), for
inspiring this project with his [FPGA-driven
INTV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CrwzyJIzMI) project.

### Test data

While I'm aiming to implement this emulator as a kind of exercise in "clean
room" implementation by referencing General Instrument documentation on the
CP1600 CPU and the other peripherals used in the Intellivision series of
consoles, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the emulator without real
hardware.

So in lieu of real INTV hardware (and a logic analyzer ðŸ’¸) I've enlisted the
help of the phenomenal [jzIntv](http://spatula-city.org/~im14u2c/intv) emulator
by Joe Zbiciak to provide some test fixtures to jump-start my development
process.

In other words, this project may not really be feasible for me without the hard
work of Joe Zbiciak and many others who have contributed to jzIntv. Thank you!
