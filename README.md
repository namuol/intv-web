# INTV JS

An Intellivision emulator for the web.

## Why?

There might be an INTV emulator for the web out there already, but I couldn't
find one easily.

I'd also like to implement a higher performance emulator for embedded/low-power
devices, so this implementation can serve as a reference for a port to a
lower-level language some day, I hope.
